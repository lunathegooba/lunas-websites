            <h3 style="text-indent:5px;"><b>Some Things I Did Within My Break</b></h3>
                <p style="font-family:cursive; text-indent: 1cm;"> While winter break was happening, <strong style="color:rgb(58, 84, 92);">I was mainly playing video games
                     (like <i>Celeste</i>), and even got back into <i>Minecraft</i>.
                     I was mainly focused on improving my mental health and hanging out with people I know.</strong>
                For the most part, it was a peaceful time. After a while, I finally started playing <i>Celeste</i> maps that were harder than any other map that I had cleared
                 (as in, I started playing Grandmaster difficulty maps)
                I had a good time throughout the break, but by the end of the year, I was beginning to feel stressed abot something. I was starting to feel <em>stressed</em> about the past and how I feel about someone. 
                They were unfortunately stuck in a bad situation, and I wanted to help them out.  </p>
                    <!--this is just spaced weirdly to make the screenshot possible-->
            <h3 style="text-indent:5px;">Changes</h3>
            <p style="font-family:cursive; text-indent: 1cm;"> I won't go too in depth about what the situation was, but it was really scary to see happen.
                 I decided that the best course of action for them was to <strong style="color:rgb(58, 92, 61);">intervene</strong>
                 after someone else began to feel <em style="color:rgb(0, 97, 100)">concerned</em> like me. It was probably one of the best decisions I've made in a very long time. After that, many things began to happen
                 but I do not want to talk about it since it is rather personal. It was a scary time, but at the end it became a really beneficial event.
            </p>
